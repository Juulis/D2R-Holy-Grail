# D2R-Holy-Grail
Offline web-based Holy Grail for Diablo 2 / D2R

Roadmap:
- a leftclick on td class "b" should increment the value in the td
- a rightclick on td class "b" should decrement the value in the td
- each td class "b" in each table should be summed and evaluated in the headline for the current table
- hover div class "u" should trigger popup containing info+image from d2-holy-grail.herokuapp/api, https://d2-holy-grail.herokuapp.com/api/items/Iron%20Pelt  (image: https://d2-holy-grail.herokuapp.com/images/items/studdedleather.gif from "image" property gotten from first api call)
- a click on div "e" should toggle ETH text
- a click on div "c" should toggle PERF text

Status: just started!
